# SustainAlign Database Models Documentation

This document provides comprehensive information about the database models used in the SustainAlign backend system.

## üìä Database Overview

The SustainAlign database is built using **SQLAlchemy ORM** with a modular structure that separates different business domains into logical model files. The system supports both **SQLite** (development) and **PostgreSQL** (production) databases.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Structure

## üìù JSON Field Management

Many models use JSON fields to store flexible, structured data. Helper methods are provided for safe JSON operations:

### Setting JSON Fields
```python
# Set SDG goals
project.set_sdg_goals([4, 9, 10])

# Set focus areas
project.set_csr_focus_areas(["Education", "Technology"])

# Set expected outcomes
project.set_expected_outcomes({
    "students_enrolled": 500,
    "villages_covered": 10
})
```

### Getting JSON Fields
```python
# Get SDG goals
sdg_list = project.get_sdg_goals()

# Get focus areas
focus_areas = project.get_csr_focus_areas()

# Get expected outcomes
outcomes = project.get_expected_outcomes()
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Operations

### Creating Records
```python
# Create a new project
project = Project(
    title="Digital Literacy Program",
    short_description="Computer education for rural students",
    ngo_name="EduCare Foundation",
    total_project_cost=2500000,
    funding_required=1500000,
    created_by=user.id
)

# Set JSON fields
project.set_sdg_goals([4, 9, 10])
project.set_csr_focus_areas(["Education", "Technology"])

# Save to database
db.session.add(project)
db.session.commit()
```

### Querying Records
```python
# Get all published projects
published_projects = Project.query.filter_by(status='published').all()

# Get projects by SDG goal
education_projects = Project.query.filter(
    Project.sdg_goals.contains('4')
).all()

# Get projects by location
bangalore_projects = Project.query.filter(
    Project.location_city.contains('Bangalore')
).all()
```

### Updating Records
```python
# Update project status
project.status = 'funded'
project.updated_at = datetime.utcnow()

# Update JSON fields
project.set_kpis({
    "digital_literacy_rate": "85%",
    "employment_placement": "70%"
})

db.session.commit()
```

## üöÄ Migration and Setup

### Initial Database Setup
```bash
# Create all tables
python migrate.py create

# Add new tables to existing database
python migrate.py add

# Create sample data
python migrate.py sample

# Check database status
python migrate.py status
```

### Database Schema Updates
```bash
# Add only new tables (preserves existing data)
python migrate.py add

# Reset entire database (WARNING: destroys all data)
python migrate.py reset
```

## üîí Security and Validation

### Input Validation
- All required fields are marked with `nullable=False`
- JSON fields are validated before storage
- Date fields are parsed and validated
- Numeric fields use appropriate precision

### Access Control
- User authentication required for all operations
- Project ownership verification for updates/deletes
- Role-based access control for admin functions
- Company association verification for applications

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
- Cascade deletes for dependent records
- Timestamp tracking for audit trails
- Status validation for workflow management

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Indexing
- Primary keys are automatically indexed
- Email fields are indexed for fast lookups
- Project title and NGO name are indexed for search
- Status fields are indexed for filtering

### Query Optimization
- Use specific filters to reduce result sets
- Leverage JSON containment operators for flexible searches
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Use eager loading for related data when needed

### Database Maintenance
- Regular database backups
- Monitor table sizes and growth
- Archive old records when appropriate
- Regular index maintenance and optimization

## üß™ Testing and Development

### Sample Data Creation
The migration script includes comprehensive sample data creation:
- Demo user accounts
- Sample company profiles
- Example projects with milestones
- NGO profiles with verification data
- Project applications and impact reports

### API Testing
Use the included `test_api.py` script to test all endpoints:
```bash
python test_api.py
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Model Extensions
- **Impact Measurement**: Advanced impact tracking and analytics
- **Financial Tracking**: Detailed budget vs actual tracking
- **Stakeholder Management**: Extended stakeholder relationship models
- **Reporting Engine**: Automated report generation models
- **Integration Models**: Third-party system integration models

### Scalability Considerations
- **Sharding**: Geographic or organizational data partitioning
- **Caching**: Redis integration for frequently accessed data
- **Search**: Full-text search integration for project discovery
- **Analytics**: Data warehouse models for advanced analytics
